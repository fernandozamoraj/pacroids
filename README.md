Pacman clone

This app is deployed to [http://pacroids.apphb.com/main.html](http://pacroids.apphb.com/main.html)

This game is a pacman clone that is written using pure JavaScript and the simple game javascript game engine.

The game is not finished.  It can certainly be finished up but due to other priorities I simply didn't get around to finishing it.

All the logic for the game, algorithms, AI, data structures, are my original thoughts and ideas.  
I have no idea what any one else's code looks like.
All I can say is that I wrote this one from scratch.

There are simply too many things that it needs to be completed to list but I'll try:

  * The level must finish.
  * Ghosts must flash white and blue as power pellet time runs out
  * Provide additional lives for pacman.
  * Pacman must die properly instead it simply ends the game for now
  * The only way to refresh the game is to refresh the page.

Give it a try and maybe you may give it a shot at fixing some of the issues.
